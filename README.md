Hastings_Powell.cps - COPASI file for the three-species food chain model in Hastings, A., & Powell, T. (1991)(Chaos in a three‚Äêspecies food chain. Ecology, 72(3), 896-903.)

Kot.cps - COPASI file for the Double forced Monod system (DFMS) by Kot, M., Sayler, G. S., & Schultz, T. W. (1992)(Complex dynamics in a model microbial system. Bulletin of Mathematical Biology, 54(4), 619-648.)

Lorenz.cps - COPASI file for the Lorenz system (Lorenz, E. N. (1963). Deterministic nonperiodic flow. Journal of atmospheric sciences, 20(2), 130-141.)

Lyap from parameter scan.R - R code to generate the parallel coordinates plot for the three systems- Lorenz, Kot and Hastings-Powell. Also, generates comparison plots of the results from genetic algorithm and simulated annealing and 3D surface plots of Lyapunov exponents and chosen parameters.

Manifold_plots.R- R code to generate a 3D plot of the solutions of the ordinary differential equations of each biological systems.
